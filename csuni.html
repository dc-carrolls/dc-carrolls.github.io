<h4>Cambridge FAQ</h4>

<h5>Can you recommend any books or activities to do that would help my application and/or studies?</h5>

<p>At the admissions stage we look for two major things: academic ability and passion for the subject. Whilst the course itself does not have any pre-requisites other than mathematics, it is difficult to discern a passion for the subject if a candidate has never tried any form of Computer Science. Therefore, from an admissions perspective, it would be wise to do something that shows your independent interest in the area. Examples of this include reading around the subject, learning a programming language, contributing to open-source projects, releasing a phone app, or building hardware (robots etc). Any one of these, when done well, would be sufficient to demonstrate your passion.</p>

<p>If you choose to learn a new language, it may be a good idea to learn one that is not explicitly taught in the Tripos. Doing so obviously helps to avoid repetition, but also gives you a wider perspective on languages that can be useful later in the degree and in employment. A popular choice is python, for which there are many tutorials available.</p>

<p>We recommend getting hold of a Raspberry Pi and following one of the many hardware and software tutorials for it on the web. An additional advantage of this route is that you will gain familiarity with the UNIX command line: a very valuable skill to have in the Tripos!</p>

<ul>
<li>Computational Fairy Tales by Jeremy Kubica. ISBN: 978-1477550298 - a romp through the principles of computational thinking, illustrating high-level computer science concepts, the motivation behind them, and their application via the medium of a fairy tale. Aimed at secondary school students. "Bonkers, but very enjoyable."</li>
<li>Computer Science: An Overview by J. Glenn Brookshear. ISBN: 978-0321544285 - overview of what computer science is all about: each topic is presented with its historical perspective, current state, and future potential, as well as ethical issues.</li>
<li>Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold. ISBN: 978-0735611313 - "What do flashlights, the British invasion, black cats, and seesaws have to do with computers? ...see how ingenuity and our very human compulsion to communicate have driven the technological innovations of the past two centuries."</li>
<li>Out of Their Minds by D Shasha and Cathy Lazere. ISBN: 978-3540979920 - the lives and discoveries of fifteen unsung computer scientists whose programs have helped people from factory owners to cartoonists.</li>
<li>The Pattern on the Stone: The Simple Ideas That Make Computers Work by Daniel Hillis. ISBN: 978-0465025961 - explains the basic concepts of the computer in everyday language.</li>
<li>The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood by James Gleick. ISBN: 978-0007225736 - a chronicle that shows how information has become "the modern era's defining quality - the blood, the fuel, the vital principle of our world."</li>
<li>The Pleasures of Counting by Tom Kôrner. ISBN: 978-0521568234 - puts Maths into the context of how it is used to solve real-world problems.</li>
<li>The Code Book by Simon Singh. ISBN: 978-1857028898 - not strictly about Computer Science, but an interesting introduction to code-breaking and cryptography, fields that have a strong connection to Computer Science.</li>
<li>The New Turing Omnibus by A Kee Dewdney. ISBN: 978-0805071665 - mini articles on Computer Science topics.</li>
<li>Algorithmic Puzzles by Anany Levitin and Maria Levitin. ISBN: 978-0199740444 - "...The emphasis lies in training the reader to think algorithmically and develop new puzzle-solving skills: the majority of puzzles are problems where we are asked to find the shortest distance or the fewest moves to get from A to B, or construct a proof that a puzzle has no solution ..."</li>
</ul>

<h4>Warwick</h4>
If you would like to read up on the more general aspects of Computer Science, we recommend:
<ul>
<li>Algorithmics: The Spirit of Computing by David Harel (third edition, Addison Wesley, 2004)</li>

<li>Computer Science: An Overview by J. Glenn Brookshear (ninth edition, Addison Wesley, 2006)</li>

<li>The New Turing Omnibus by A.K. Dewdney (W.H. Freeman & Co, 2001)</li>

<li>Another lively, informative (and short!) book by David Harel is Computers LTD. What they really can't do (Oxford University Press, 2000)</li>
</ul>
The Linux operating system is used throughout the course, and useful introductions are:
<ul>
<li>Introducing UNIX and Linux by Mike Joy, Stephen Jarvis and Michael Luck (Palgrave, 2002)</li>

<li>UNIX for Programmers and Usersby King Ables and Graham Glass (fourth edition, Prentice Hall, 2006)</li>

</ul>
For the hardware/applications element of the course one of the following is recommended:
<ul>
<li>The Principles of Computer Hardware by Alan Clements (fourth edition, Oxford, 2006)</li>

<li>Structured Computer Organisation by Andrew Tanenbaum (fifth edition, Prentice Hall, 2005)</li>

</ul>
The first year modules have a high mathematical content and some of the topics covered may appear somewhat abstract when compared with A-Level Mathematics. Two books well worth reading as preliminary work in this area are:
<ul>
<li>Foundations of Mathematics by Ian Stewart and David Tall (Oxford, 1977)</li>

<li>Modern Engineering Mathematics by Glyn James (third edition, Prentice Hall, 2001)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Activities:</h3>


<h3>Computer Science A-Level</h3>
<p>The newer Computing A-Levels resemble much of what we teach in our first year, so it is worth remembering that studying the A-Level will currently result in repetition of material at University. Some students (and Directors of Studies) therefore prefer to broaden their horizons and study related subjects such as an extra science. </p>
