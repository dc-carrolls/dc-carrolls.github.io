<h2>Problem</h2>    
Build a desktop Raspberry Pi v4 computer to support code club, student projects and competitions
Needed plenty of storage for images of SD Cards for various projects.
Needs to have resilient storage as system will not be supported/backed up by computer services.

<h2>Design</h2>
Initially looked at a two disk HDD enclosure with hardware raid controller. Researched showed that this would
not provide the resilience I expected. RAID is designed for high availability rather than resilience 
Opted for a fast SSD primary drive (2TB) and a cheap HDD secondary drive 
FIle system ext4 - now supported in Win10 - or use utility

<ul>
    <li>Flash latest image to SD card or:</li>
    <li>sudo apt-get update</li>
    <li>sudo apt-get upgrade -y</li>
    <li>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y</li>
    <li>Used Raspberry Pi Imager to copy latest Raspbian onto USB Drive</li>

    <li>sudo apt-get install hdparm</li>
