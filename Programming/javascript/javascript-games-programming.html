This course is based on the W3Schools.com HTML Game Example

You will need some programming tools (development environment). The simplist option is to use repl.it 
but my preference is to use GitHub/GitHub Desktop and VS Code if you are using your own computer and can
install them.

You will be able to try out all the code and make your own changes within the W3Schools tutorial, but 
you will need your own development environment if you want to keep any code and build your own game.

The animation makes use of a Canvas and the <a href = "w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp">setInterval</a> function


introduction

Try the example game, have a quick look at the code, this is where we want to get to, but don't 
worry we'll progress in small steps.

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_canvas.asp">Game Canvas</a>

Task: Click the Try it Yourself button and look at the code. 
The HTML and CSS should look familiar. Change the colours of the canvas background and border
change the size of the canvas. Press the Run button to see the changes.

Have a look <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp">here</a> at how to specify colours
using names or numbers.

Introduce concept of function and sequence. 

No need to save this task, so move on to 

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_components.asp">Game Components</a>

Follow the examples down to and including "Make it move"

Copy this code into your own development environment (GitHub or Repl.it)

Introduce concept of selection with if statement. Make compnent bounce back from edges of canvas.

Task: Make the square move in x & y directions bouncing off all edges of canvas.

Collisions looked at in more detail later

Complete the rest of the Game Components section 


Game Controllers

Here we'll see more of selection (if statements and the AND && operator) and introduce events and listeners

Start off with creating some onscreen buttons and associated events "onClick", "onmousedown", "onmouseup" and "ontouchstart"

Work down to "Keyboard as a Controller"

Introduce an event listener and boolean values for using keyboard keys.

Here we see the AND operator (syntax &&)
